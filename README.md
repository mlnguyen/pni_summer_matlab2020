# Introduction to MATLAB 2020

Instructor: Mai Nguyen, mlnguyen@princeton.edu 

Meeting time: MW, 2-3:30pm from June 10-July 29 on zoom

Office hours: by appointment, very flexible

This class is an introduction to scientific computing using MATLAB for students with little to no experience with programming or statistics. Weeks 1-4 will focus on programming fundamentals, and Weeks 5-8 will walk through a simple data analysis pipeline and touch on advanced topics. This is a highly compressed course and will not cover everything you will need to know to do your research. The goal is to cover the basics and learn “enough” to get started on figuring out what you need to do, while emphasizing best practices.

Class structure
*	Combination of lecture and working through class examples
*	Weekly assignments (2-3 hours, maybe longer for later topics) assigned Friday, due following Tuesday. I’ll provide written feedback/comments on assignments and will be available for one-one-one meetings
